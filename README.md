# Butterfly Effect: Small Changes, Big Impacts

## Concept:
This project demonstrates how small changes in solar energy or temperature due to climate change can trigger a butterfly effect, impacting multiple Earth systems. It focuses on showing how a seemingly minor change can ripple through wildfires, air quality, and human health.

## Key Components:

### Core Focus Areas:
1. **Solar Energy/Temperature Increase**: The starting small change.
2. **Wildfires**: A direct consequence of increased temperatures.
3. **Air Quality**: Deterioration due to wildfire smoke.
4. **Human Health**: Impact on respiratory issues due to air quality degradation.

### Interactive Elements:
- **Step 1**: Users adjust a slider (representing a minor increase in solar energy or temperature) to watch how a small temperature change causes ripple effects across different systems.
  - Small increase (1-2°C) → Slight increase in wildfire risk.
  - Large increase (3-5°C) → Higher frequency and intensity of wildfires.
  
- **Step 2**: The next ripple shows how wildfires cause poor air quality, using simplified data or visualizations.
  
- **Step 3**: Finally, users will see how worsening air quality affects human health, particularly respiratory issues, depicted by basic human impact icons or data.

### Visuals and Data:
- **Butterfly Ripple Animation**: A butterfly or ripple visual symbolizes the spread of effects across the systems as the slider moves. The small flap of the butterfly’s wings (small solar change) ripples outward to affect larger systems (wildfires, air quality, health).
- **Data Source**: Use NASA’s **EIC Gallery** or **Images of Change** for visuals on wildfires and air quality changes, supported by real-world data.

### Video Explainer (Optional):
- **Content**: A short 30-minute video introducing the butterfly effect concept, focusing on how small changes in solar energy or temperature can impact interconnected Earth systems.
  - Example: Highlight the increase in wildfires and subsequent effects on air quality and human health.

## User Flow:
1. **Introduction**: The user watches a brief video explaining how small changes in solar energy can trigger a ripple effect across Earth systems.
2. **Interactive Slider**: Users adjust a solar energy/temperature slider to see how this small change ripples out to affect wildfires, air quality, and human health.
3. **Data and Visuals**: For each stage of the ripple (temperature → wildfire → air quality → health), users see a brief pop-up or infographic explaining the cause-and-effect relationship.

### Simplified Visualization:
- Use simple animations or graphics to show:
  - A small temperature rise (due to solar fluctuations or climate change) sparking wildfires.
  - The fires generate smoke, deteriorating air quality.
  - Human icons representing health effects (e.g., more people using inhalers).
  
- **Data Sources**: NASA’s **EIC Gallery**, **Meteomatics Weather API**, or static climate datasets to illustrate these changes.

## Technology and Tools:

### APIs/Resources:
1. **NASA Images of Change**: Visuals of wildfires and air quality changes over time.
2. **NASA EIC Gallery**: Data or imagery about climate change impacts on temperature, wildfires, and air quality.
3. **Firebase** or **Google Cloud Platform**: To host the website and track user interactions.

### Web-Based Tool:
- Create a simple interactive web app using **Google Cloud** or **GoDaddy** for hosting.
- Optionally uses **Tableau Public** to visualize temperature changes and their ripple effects through wildfires and air quality.

### Multimedia Elements:
- **Canva** or **Adobe Spark**: To create the video explainer and design simple animations for the butterfly ripple effect.
- **Basic Sound Effects**: Ambient sounds to reinforce the butterfly ripple effect (e.g., wind for wildfires, breathing for air quality changes).
